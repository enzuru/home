# enzuru's home directory

This is my home directory for POSIX operating systems; my dotfiles, scripts, configuration, and Lisp code for [SBCL](https://www.sbcl.org/), [Slynk](https://github.com/joaotavora/sly), etc. It tries to be mostly distro and OS agnostic.

My StumpWM configuration is in [a separate repo](https://github.com/enzuru/.stumpwm.d).
