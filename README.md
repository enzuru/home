# enzuru's home directory

This is my home directory for POSIX operating systems; my dotfiles, scripts, configuration, and Lisp code for [SBCL](https://www.sbcl.org/), [Slynk](https://github.com/joaotavora/sly), etc. It tries to be mostly distro and OS agnostic.

My StumpWM configuration is in [a separate repo](https://github.com/enzuru/.stumpwm.d).

Using [org-roam-ui](https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam-ui), you can [navigate a tree visualizing](https://enzuru.github.io/lisp-user-space/) how my [Lisp user space](https://github.com/enzuru) tools work together on the [GNU operating system](https://gnu.org).
